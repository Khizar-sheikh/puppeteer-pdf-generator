# PDF Generator

This project is a PDF generator tool built using Puppeteer and Headless Chrome. It allows users to convert HTML content into PDF documents programmatically.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/pdf-generator.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd pdf-generator
   ```

3. Install the dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

## Usage

1. Modify the HTML template (`template.html`) to customize the content of your PDF document. You can use placeholders for dynamic content.

2. Run the `generatePDF.js` script to generate the PDF:

   ```bash
   node generatePDF.js
   ```

3. The generated PDF will be saved as `output.pdf` in the project directory.

## Configuration

- Modify the CSS styles in `styles.css` to customize the appearance of your PDF document.
- Adjust the Puppeteer options in `generatePDF.js` as needed, such as page size, margins, and print background color.
